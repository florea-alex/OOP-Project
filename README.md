# OOP-Project
As an assignment for my Faculty, first year second semester, I had to implement an OOP project where I design a Medicine Cabinet in C++. The project contains the following: constructors, destructors, method overriding, overloading basic operators (>>, <<, =, +, postfix & prefix increment/decrement, index [] etc.), IS-A and HAS-A relationships, abstract classes, interfaces, virtual classes and a system menu.
